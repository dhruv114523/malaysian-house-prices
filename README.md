# Malaysia Housing Price Analysis (2025) — Initial EDA

This project explores Malaysia's 2025 residential housing market using a dataset of 2,000 property records across all states.

## Current Work
- Grouped analysis of median price per square foot (PSF) by:
  - State
  - Property type (e.g., Condominium, Terrace, Semi-D)
- Summary statistics to identify regional pricing patterns and affordability trends

## Tools
- Python (pandas)

## Dataset
Sourced from Brickz — includes location, tenure, type, pricing, and transaction data.

## Next Steps
- Visualization in Power BI
- Regional dashboards and KPI tracking
- Optional modeling (e.g., price prediction or clustering)
